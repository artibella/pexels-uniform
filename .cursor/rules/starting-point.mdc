# About this project

This project is to provide an asset integration for Pexels that allows you to search and add assets to the Uniform asset parameters.

This codebase is a fork from a similar integration for Unsplash (another free stock photo and image service). The original integration is called `UniSplash` or `unisplash` in code.

The goal is to convert this code base to work with Pexels and its API features.

When building functions try to avoid naming them after the specific service so it is easier to port the code to other asset services:

A bad example for a function name is: `searchPexelPhotos`
A good example for a function name is: `searchPhotos`

Only exception is if you need to rely on functionality that is specific to that service and it makes little sense to have a generic naming. Then it is ok to call that out in naming of functions, variables or files.

This project should not stay compatible with Unsplash so try to avoid keeping Unsplash related code.
