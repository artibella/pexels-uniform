# Working with Pexels


[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) is a free service for stock photos, royalty free images & videos shared by creators.

It allows you to search for photos and videos using their [APIs](https://www.pexels.com/api/). See the [API documentation](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/) for more details.

When developing with Pexels use their official Javascript client library: 
- Package name: `pexels` 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pexels)
- [Githhub](https://github.com/pexels/pexels-javascript)

To install this package you can use following command:
```
npm install pexels --save
```
An example request to search for photos using this client:

```
import { createClient } from 'pexels';

const client = createClient('YOUR_API_KEY');
const query = 'Nature';

client.photos.search({ query, per_page: 1 }).then(photos => {...});
```
